# Mimic releases

Release archives are built from a clean, committed `moreveal/mimic` revision.
Windows and Linux must use the same source revision. The Package release CI
workflow can run the same preparation and upload its verified archives and
receipts. Download both artifacts into `.build/releases/VERSION/` before
publishing, and verify the run's source revision is the release commit.

## Prepare

Requirements: Go 1.26.4+, a platform C compiler, Python 3.12+, Node.js 22+, and
the Linux fonts documented in [getting started](../../docs/getting-started.md).
Rust/Cargo is a build-time requirement for the native Blitz producer.

```powershell
python tools/release/prepare.py --version v0.1.6
```

Run the equivalent command under Ubuntu 24.04/WSL2 for Linux. The tool builds a
content-addressed, locked native producer first and then builds the public
`./cmd/mimic` command as a stripped standalone binary. It assembles the
allowlisted package, collects third-party notices, and verifies the extracted
package with V8, QuickJS, goja, Playwright, Puppeteer, and the concurrency
example.

The release entry point is deliberately the single command above. Do not package
`tools/runmimic`: it is a source-checkout bootstrap that may invoke Cargo. Do not
invoke `go build` directly for a clean release checkout without first running
`go run ./tools/buildnative`; the release tool performs both operations in the
required order. The resulting `mimic`/`mimic.exe` contains the statically linked
native producer and needs neither Go, Rust nor Cargo on an end-user machine.

For a local unpackaged release-equivalent build:

```powershell
go run ./tools/buildnative
go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o .build/mimic.exe ./cmd/mimic
```

On Linux, use `.build/mimic` as the output path. This binary is the same command
the release packager builds; `go run ./tools/runmimic` is only the convenient
clean-checkout development path.

## Version shown by the binary

The startup banner derives its version from Go build information through
`runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo`. Do not add a second version constant, edit source
files for a release, or inject a display version with `-ldflags -X`.

- A semantic module version is displayed unchanged, for example `v0.1.5`.
- A repository build displays `dev+<short-revision>` from the embedded
  `vcs.revision` and adds `-dirty` when Go records modified sources.
- A Go pseudo-version such as `v0.0.0-20260920165425-17f508b820af` describes a
  development build and is normalized to `dev+17f508b8`; it must never be shown
  as the Mimic release version.

The `--version` passed to `prepare.py` names and validates release artifacts; it
does not create another runtime version source. Before publishing, build from
the intended clean commit and verify the banner provenance against that commit.

Outputs are written to `.build/releases/VERSION/`. Reusing an existing
version/platform output directory is rejected so stale artifacts cannot be
mistaken for a fresh build.

## Publish

Push the exact release commit to `moreveal/mimic`, then run:

```powershell
python tools/release/publish.py --version v0.1.6
```

Publication requires verified Windows and Linux receipts for the current commit.
It creates a draft release, uploads the archives, manifest, and checksums,
downloads every asset to verify its hash, and only then publishes the release.
The receipts and archive hashes are authoritative; the publisher does not wait
for CI. Use only artifacts from a successful run for the exact release commit.

## Publish the website

Updating the separate `moreveal/mimic-overview` website is a required part of
every release. After publishing the GitHub Release:

1. Update every displayed version and version-specific download link in the
   website repository.
2. Copy the release's `RELEASE_NOTES.md` to the website repository unchanged.
   The website changelog and the GitHub Release body must have exactly the same
   source text; do not maintain a shortened or rewritten website variant.
3. Run `npm run build` and `npm run test:links` in `mimic-overview`.
4. Commit and push `main`, then verify that the GitHub Pages deployment succeeds
   and that the live changelog shows the new release.

A release is not complete until both the GitHub Release and the public website
are published and verified.
