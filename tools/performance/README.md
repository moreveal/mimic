# Fast performance iteration gate

Run with the frozen benchmark Python environment:

```
python tools/performance/fast_gate.py --output .build/fast-gate-UNIQUE
```

`--source` selects a source checkout for a before/after comparison. Each invocation builds its own executable into a new output directory. `build.json` records the build command, source revision/status, executable SHA-256 and frozen harness/workload hashes. Every process launch verifies and records the executable hash before invoking the frozen Runtime with that exact absolute path. A mismatch aborts immediately. Existing output directories are refused to preserve evidence.

The gate imports `benchmark/run.py`; it does not edit the frozen runner or workload fixtures. All six workload result checks are mandatory. Timings cover five measured warm iterations of DOM, static and React, then three measured static waves at N=10 and N=25. Each timing series also has one excluded warm-up, following the frozen suite. Memory is sampled with ten live static pages and ten live React pages in separate fresh processes, before teardown, immediately after teardown and after the same 250 ms recovery interval. No forced garbage collection is added. Concurrency retains the frozen memory-pressure and paging limits. Raw rows, failures and warm-ups are retained.

Run repository correctness regressions for each production change; this gate supplements those tests. Use the full frozen matrix only at a substantial improvement milestone. Fast gate timings cannot replace the original full-suite baseline or certify unmeasured N=50 targets.

Check executable mismatch handling with:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tools/performance -p test_fast_gate.py
```


At a substantial improvement milestone, use the full wrapper:

```
python tools/performance/full_gate.py --output benchmark/runs/UNIQUE-MILESTONE --chrome PATH-TO-PINNED-CHROME
```

It runs the unchanged full matrix. Its Runtime subclass verifies the just-built Mimic executable before every launch and also verifies the pinned Chrome executable against its initial hash; `launches.jsonl` records each check. Both wrappers reject a harness fingerprint that differs from the original baseline. The original benchmark files remain untouched.

## CDP operation latency diagnostics

`python tools/performance/click_latency.py --binary .build/mimic.exe --output .build/click-UNIQUE`
creates a fresh Context, adds one local TodoMVC item, and verifies six real
checkbox clicks. `--site github` checks a README disclosure; the harness refuses
to click if the projected point hits a different control. The current geometry
model can fail that guard. `--site github-probe` measures repeated hit tests and
safe mouse movement without activating links. `--site blast --clicks 6` runs
three login-menu open/Escape-close cycles, checking `aria-expanded` after every
action without filling or submitting a form. Add `--exercise-form` to also wait
for the visible login field, verify its projected hit, click it, type the fixed
synthetic text `mimic-latency-check`, and clear it. This never submits the form.
Form readiness, field-click and typing/clearing latencies are separate metrics.
`--chrome --binary PATH` runs the
same observation against pinned Chrome. `--profile-cdp` retains server command
timings for attribution; keep it separate from unprofiled latency measurements.
Outputs include executable and harness hashes, source status, per-command and
per-action timings, validated state, lifecycle events, and 100 ms process-tree
RSS/private-memory/CPU snapshots. CPU snapshots count only currently live
processes; they are not a cumulative account of exited Chrome children.
Each run has an outer timeout and closes its own processes. Use a fresh output
directory. Live HTML can differ between engines and runs, so these observations
do not replace the frozen workload comparison.

`python tools/performance/live_latency.py --before .build/before.exe --after .build/after.exe --output .build/live-latency-UNIQUE`
records five alternating clean-process trials of ChatGPT login, GitHub,
SpigotMC, Modrinth, React and Wikipedia. It retains binary/source hashes,
per-command client timing, resource/lifecycle events and validated DOM results.
The original desktop login script and frozen comparison runner are not edited.
Use `--mode both --preview both --sites chatgpt` to separate retained Contexts
and an actual preview subscriber. Startup discovery uses a bounded connection
probe; totals include process startup, unlike a script attaching to an already
running browser.

`--sites geometry` runs one warm-up and 30 local read/mutation/real-click
iterations on a 200-element DOM; reads sample four separated elements.
`--sites geometry-stress` reads all 200 once, kept separate because the original
runtime takes tens of seconds per operation. Do not pool these two workloads.

For diagnostic runs only, `--profile-cdp` enables `MIMIC_PROFILE_CDP=1` and
saves the Page trace. `commandTiming` records command/session IDs, queue delay,
session/Page lock wait, remaining handler work, JSON serialization and socket
write/wait durations, including the enclosing events for legacy nested sessions.
Parameters and results are not
retained in those timing events. Normal connections do not collect timings.
`workMs` is remaining wall time, including awaited execution or debugger pauses,
not a CPU measurement; use the CPU/block profiles to attribute it further.
Timeouts terminate a trial instead of leaving repeated evaluations queued.

`python tools/performance/runtime_latency.py --binary .build/mimic.exe --output .build/runtime-new.json`
uses a local generated DOM, validates each operation, and reports cold/warm Page,
selector, live-collection, traversal and mutation timings with recovery RSS.
It requires `pyppeteer` and `psutil`, records the executable hash, and does not
replace the frozen gate. Use a fresh output path for every comparison.

For an opt-in live native/Go profile, set `MIMIC_LATENCY_PROFILE_URL`,
`MIMIC_LATENCY_PROFILE_DIR`, `MIMIC_PROFILE_HOSTS=1`, and optionally
`MIMIC_LATENCY_PROFILE_EXPRESSION`, then run
`go test ./internal/browser -run '^TestRuntimeLatencyProfile$' -v -count=1`.
`MIMIC_LATENCY_PROFILE_KIND` selects `native`, `go-cpu`, `go-memory`,
`go-block`, or `go-mutex` for separate attribution runs; unset or `all` retains
the combined diagnostic. Only the selected profiler is started/exported
(`go-memory` writes sampled `allocs` and `heap`). Explicit Go modes suppress an
inherited navigation-native profiler. Host tracing remains independently
controlled by `MIMIC_PROFILE_HOSTS`. Every mode retains pump/selector work,
`hosts.json`, `diagnostics.json`, and records its mode in `profile-metadata.json`.
Use a fresh output directory per run so stale profiles cannot mix modes.
Use an absolute `MIMIC_LATENCY_PROFILE_DIR`: `go test` runs the test from the
package directory. Keep attribution runs separate from unprofiled latency runs.

`MIMIC_PROFILE_TEXT_CACHE=1` independently enables bounded cache-hit/miss,
eviction and successful-working-set counters. The latency profile test exports
them to `text-cache.json`. It records seeded key fingerprints rather than author
text; after the diagnostic key limit the distinct working-set estimate is marked
as a lower bound. This is disabled by default and is not a timing baseline.

`MIMIC_V8_CPU_PROFILE=1` plus `MIMIC_V8_CPU_PROFILE_FILTER` selects a script-name
substring for an additional native profile during navigation. Profiling changes
execution cost; use unprofiled binaries for latency claims.
The combined `all` mode also writes allocation, heap, mutex, block and goroutine
profiles without forcing GC. Set `MIMIC_LATENCY_PROFILE_PUMP_SECONDS=20` to
observe network continuations and subsequent tasks for a wall-clock window;
otherwise the diagnostic retains its original twenty-turn sample.

`MIMIC_LATENCY_PROFILE_ACTIONS` optionally names a JSON action array for the
same profiled Page, after the initial pump and expression probes. An action can
contain `expression` (state inspection), `method` and `params` (production
`Input.dispatchMouseEvent` / `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`), and `waitMs` (pump Page
tasks after the action). Keep coordinate preflight checks and state assertions
in the expressions. Input replay is diagnostic, not a replacement for a real
CDP client latency baseline. The enclosing 90-second deadline bounds pumping.


### Additional concurrency scaling

`concurrency_scaling.py` reuses the frozen runner and checks every Page result.
Pass fresh `--before`, `--after`, the pinned `--chrome` executable, and a new
`--output` directory. Defaults cover 10/25/50/100 static Pages and 50 React Pages.
Use `--cases static:100 --order before after` for a bounded repeated comparison.
The output records binary hashes, per-Page latency, wave throughput and RSS
before/while targets are retained/250 ms after teardown, without forced GC.
