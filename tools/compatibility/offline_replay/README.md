# Recorded multi-cycle replay

This local diagnostic executable loads the manual capture format (`trace.json`
and `root-<request-id>.json`) and runs its saved document in Mimic with a
replacement Page transport. It never falls back to a live transport. Run it only
against trusted captures; the scripts execute in the actual browser runtime.
Raw input and output contain private page data and belong in ignored directories.

```powershell
go test ./tools/compatibility/offline_replay -count=1
go build -o .build/offline-replay.exe ./tools/compatibility/offline_replay
.build/offline-replay.exe -capture compatibility/private-captures/CAPTURE -out .build/REPLAY
```

Selection uses the recorded method, exact URL, request occurrence, resource
initiator, mapped realm context and top navigation cycle. Later GET documents
are consumed once. Repeated POSTs also consume their own responses. Relative
ordering of unrelated resource requests may differ; this is not a global network
schedule simulator.

The `criticalClientHintsRestart` trace event explicitly permits one duplicate
response per recorded restart. The initial wire response is absent from this
capture format, so the final response body and headers are reused **as an
inference** for that restart. This is labeled `criticalRetryCopy`. Other duplicate
request IDs and redirect topologies without enough evidence fail capture loading.

Recorded cache and blob/synthetic outputs are excluded from transport selection.
The live runtime generates them and their observation is recorded as `local`.
Local matching checks context, initiator, cycle, scheme/URL and status; it does
not compare blob body bytes. A different cache decision remains visible as an
`unmatched-local` observation plus an unused wire fixture. The replay does not
force a network request to hide that difference.

Saved transport failures, including DNS failures, are returned with their saved
error text. A failure that was actually recorded does not end replay. An unknown
request, exhausted response queue, missing context or configured limit cancels
the run. The result always reports remaining fixtures, so an exhausted queue
cannot be mistaken for the end of every captured cycle. A new local blob or cache
observation alone does not cancel the run; it is reported separately.

`replay-result.json` contains input and binary hashes, build metadata, selected
fixture indices, cycles, request body hashes/equality, differing header names,
explicit bounds, stopping condition and unused records. `replay-trace.json`
retains the private full browser trace. Keep process stderr and exit code next
to these files, especially for native failure investigations.

## Optional diagnostic changes

`-rebase-http-dates` translates Date, Expires and Last-Modified by one offset
from the capture's first event time to replay wall time. Age, Cache-Control,
relative expiry intervals, bodies and original files remain unchanged. Every
served response records the offset. This opt-in environment control prevents
the age of an archived capture from expiring otherwise fresh cache responses;
it is not evidence of literal header equivalence. The unmodified run and its
stopping boundary should be retained alongside a rebased comparison.

Some captured programs embed a newly generated path identifier in a subsequent
request. Exact matching intentionally fails in that case. A private replay may
opt in to `-dynamic-segment '<regexp with exactly one captured ID>'`. The matched
path fragment is normalized for selection, and the saved ID is replaced with the
new ID in that response body. This is an explicit harness transformation, not a
browser fix or evidence that a server would accept the new identifier. The
expression and each actual substitution appear in the receipt. Do not use this
option for a comparison that requires byte-identical response bodies.

`-body-overrides file.json` accepts a map from zero-based network response index
to a local replacement body path. Use separate output directories for original
and instrumented responses. Each replacement's content hash is recorded; the
original capture stays unchanged. Native trace-only diagnostics may instead use
Go's `-overlay` build argument. Preserve the overlay and its hash with the run.

## Interpretation boundary

Response bytes are already decoded in manual captures, so the replacement strips
Content-Encoding and Content-Length and supplies the decoded length. It does not
reproduce TLS/H2/H3, wire timing, previous cookies/storage, OS/GPU behavior, or a
fresh server decision. Body/header differences are reported, not submitted to a
server evaluator. Reaching a stored continuation proves execution coverage only;
it does not prove acceptance or identify the cause of a live refusal.

Defaults bound execution to 60 seconds, 1600 scheduler advances and 256 transport
requests; all are configurable within hard limits. This is a causal debugging
tool, not a wall-clock benchmark or a native stability stress gate.
