# Handle ownership experiment, 2026-09-14

Selected production code and focused regression tests are retained. Temporary
implementation patches and diagnostic executables are discarded after the
decision. [Raw observations and executable hashes](data/optimization-20260914/handles/)
include both the rejected first candidate and accepted second candidate.
The [Worker follow-up](worker-handle-ownership-20260914.md) extends this ownership
model. Incoming cached module-graph errors remain borrowed; only locally created
evaluation errors may be consumed by a dynamic-import completion.

Candidate source: detached worktree `spike-handles-20260914`, based on `f07bd2d643eebbadc28d582ef93f01c832a50106`. Production patch: `handles-v2.patch` (SHA256 `02a2e8e36b1b53b3a714db8e18ab6e30f5ea6735e085ae8e79052d27eb93cfb6`). The patch includes focused correctness tests; the opt-in diagnostic is separate, `lifetime_profile_test.go` (SHA256 `eec1f42c91ad6561b7af9b4905646a635b52914d45110b111f2d32db8b488a7f`).

Linux WSL Ubuntu 24.04. Each process runs one Page, same loopback workload server and native V8 backend. Measurements were serialized, with root and other agents' builds/tests stopped. The order was control, candidate, candidate, control. Each raw directory contains its binary hash and test log. The diagnostics were built as browser test executables; these are not production CDP harness timings and do not establish any Chrome speed ratio. Tracing stayed enabled. Native `ProfileCollect` and Go GC were explicit diagnostic interventions after each workload; their duration is recorded separately as `reclaim_ms`. No automatic GC policy was changed.

Control binary SHA256: `3b744676c44e28997a9320cbccdd977ea1295798269ffdbc4f01b622f37e50bb`.

Rejected first candidate SHA256: `a7103ee326b5244dde7be13061de6d6cafd338498b8a18263947107f64ca0f0a`. It eliminated Eval roots, but dispatching each release separately slowed scalar evaluations by 15.6% and Promise evaluations by 27.2%. Raw: `control-1`, `candidate-1`, `candidate-2`, `control-2`. This variant must not be promoted.

Selected second candidate SHA256: `6d573ad8a39ed0996068995fe152f61804bce90d3b5f90c1188df90d4c6d6420`. It groups Await, export and releases on the existing owning thread, closes Globals without allocating a local scope, retains only the callback needed by a timer and releases it on completion/cancel. It also uses borrowed arguments for synchronous URL/baseURI, clock, checkpoint and Fetch hosts. Native host Promise values are borrowed for the current callback; only pending resolvers remain rooted until settlement. Ordinary Runtime.NewPromise preserves caller ownership of Value.

Raw second series: `control-v2-1`, `candidate-v2-1`, `candidate-v2-2`, `control-v2-2`. Means of the two executions per variant:

| Scenario | Operations | Control ms | Candidate ms | Native roots retained: control -> candidate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Eval returning scalar from an object expression | 256 | 61.97 | 51.44 | 256 -> 0 |
| Eval returning a fulfilled Promise | 256 | 67.52 | 54.75 | 512 -> 0 |
| Actual Fetch/arrayBuffer, 64 KiB each | 16 | 266.23 | 261.30 | 368 -> 0 |
| EventTarget listener registration/dispatch/removal | 1024 | 6.44 | 6.58 | 1028 -> 0 |
| Timers run, capturing 4 KiB each | 1024 | 248.02 | 204.52 | 6152 -> 0 |
| Timers canceled, capturing 4 KiB each | 1024 | 11.15 | 8.48 | 6148 -> 0 |
| Page.Close after the sequence | 1 | 5.50 | 1.86 | isolate disposed |

After the entire sequence and recovery, V8 used heap was 27.07 -> 17.05 MiB, external memory 8.25 -> 0.25 MiB. The remaining 0.25 MiB is also present at the initial baseline. All 8 MiB of timer-captured payloads recovered before Page.Close. Go heap was approximately 19.51 -> 18.52 MiB before close; after close and recovery both variants were approximately 18.07 MiB. These include live BrowserContext/trace and test state and are not process-private RSS claims. The Fetch Go allocation volume remains approximately 78.6 MiB for 16 bodies in this isolated handles patch; the independent binary-transfer candidate removes that separate cost.

Listener wall time differs by +2.1% in this tiny series, below the 5% rejection threshold and too small a sample for a throughput claim. All other sampled operation medians improve. The 2.95x close result concerns this retained-state sequence only, not ordinary cold Page creation or application execution.

Correctness: Windows focused V8 and browser tests passed, including repeated Page evaluations across three create/close cycles; independent retained values; original JS exception identity through host rethrow; reentrant Promise settlement; JS-held Promises/results surviving native cleanup; completed/canceled/self-cleared timer registrations; interval continuation after a handled exception; Fetch binary/clone/abort/origin/redirect behavior; Window/Worker Fetch; and same-realm/cross-realm borrowed-call behavior. A separate Linux focused browser run of the first candidate passed. Linux v2 diagnostic verifies correct results in every scenario; final integrated Linux/race/fast gate checks remain the root agent's promotion gate.

Limits: Worker Fetch/GPU Promise ownership is covered, but Worker timer callbacks retain the older lifecycle and require a separate bounded follow-up. Errors returned to a native caller still transfer a live ThrownValue root to that caller; only errors handled by a host rethrow or finished dynamic import are released here. Cross-realm owners, listener data actually retained by JavaScript, debugger object groups, cache/history retention and arbitrary service callbacks are not globally rewritten. This patch proves elimination of temporary roots in the listed long-lived Page scenarios, not universal zero retention for every Web API.
